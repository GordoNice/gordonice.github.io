This visualization was done as an illustrative material for lecture on the
"Physics and Technology of Accelerators" at Dubna State University. Coded with
[VPython](https://vpython.org/) and powered by [GlowScript](https://www.glowscript.org).

The control of the motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic fields
is described by the following formula:

$$\vec{F}=\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}=\vec{F}_{\text{el.}}+\vec{F}_{\text{mag.}}=Q\vec{E}+Q[\vec{v}, {\vec{B}}]$$

In the program you can control parameters from formula and check what changes.
