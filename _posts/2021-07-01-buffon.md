The video above illustrates the famous [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem).
This experiment can be used to design a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)
for approximating the number $\pi$. That's why this example is considered to be a classic Monte Carlo implementation.

# Description of the experiment

In the simplest case, the Buffon's needle problem is formulated as follows: if needles or
sticks of length $L$ were accidentally thrown on a flat surface with parallel lines
drawn on it at a distance $D \geq L$ from each other, the probability $P_{\text{cross}}$
of the thrown needle crossing one of these lines can be expressed as:

$$ \label{eq:prob}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{2L}{\pi D}.
$$

# Proof of the result

The proof for this particular case is quite trivial. Suppose a needle of length
$L$ is dropped onto a floor with evenly spaced parallel lines of width $D$ (see fig. 1).
The probability of the event where the needle crosses a line was shown above
(see eq. \eqref{eq:prob}), but how to get this result?

To solve the problem we must develop a method of "locating" a needle of length
$L$ that has fallen onto the floor. Let $x$ be the perpendicular distance from
the end of the needle nearest you to the nearest line above it. Let $\theta$ be
the acute angle between the needle and a line through the end of the needle
nearest you, parallel to the line (see fig. 2).

</figure>

Now let $t$ be the perpendicular distance from the other end of the needle to
this line. We see that $\sin{\theta} = \frac{t}{L}$, so $t = L\sin{\theta}$.

It can be seen, if $t > x$, then the needle will cross the line. Thus, we have a
successful toss when $x < L\sin{\theta}$. We also note that the following
restrictions fall on $\theta$ and $x$: $0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ and 
$0 \leq x \leq D$.

In the [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yqbgrdbdt7) below see the
resulting rectangle from blue and green restrictions areas. This rectangle
constitutes the sample for our experiment. The variables for the experiment are
$\theta$ and $x$, and we consider $D$ and $L$ as constants.

For simplicity, let's consider only the $D \geq L$ case of possible relationships
between $D$ and $L$. From the [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yqbgrdbdt7)
we can see, that the probability that a toss is a success is:

$$ \label{eq:prob_proof_text}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{\text{area under the curve}}{\text{area of the rectangle}},
$$

that is,

$$ \label{eq:probability_proof}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{L\int_0^{\pi/2}{\sin{\theta}d\theta}}{D\frac{\pi}{2}}=\frac{(-\cos{\frac{\pi}{2}})-(-\cos{0})}{\frac{D\pi}{2L}}=\frac{2L}{D\pi}(-0+1)=\frac{2L}{\pi D},
$$

So, that's how we get the result from eq. \eqref{eq:prob}.

Suppose we estimated $P_{\text{cross}}$ not analytically but empirically, by
throwing needles, let's call it $\hat{P}_{\text{cross}}$. Thus,

$$
\hat{P}_{\text{cross}}\approx\frac{2L}{\pi D},
$$

or

$$ \label{eq:pi_est}
\pi\approx\frac{2L}{\hat{P}_{\text{cross}} D}.
$$

Using this hack we can estimate the $\pi$ number dropping a needle on the floor!

This can be seen from the video at the top of the page, there $L = D = 1$ and
$\hat{P}\_{\text{cross}}=\frac{S}{N}$, where $N$ --- number of throws, $S$ ---
number of crossings. So, the $\pi$ estimation, following eq. \eqref{eq:pi_est}
can be found as $\pi\approx\frac{2N}{S}$.

After 100 throws we estimated $\pi\approx3.226$, surely, the more throws
we make, the better the result will be.

Now you should understand the video from the beginning &#128521;
