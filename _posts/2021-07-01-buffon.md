The video above illustrates the famous [Buffon's needle problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem).
This experiment can be used to design a [Monte Carlo method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)
for approximating the number $\pi$. That's why this example is considered to be a classic Monte Carlo implementation.

# The description of experiment

In the simplest case, the Buffon's needle problem is formulated as follows: if needles or
sticks of length $L$ were accidentally thrown on a flat surface with parallel lines
drawn on it at a distance $D \geq L$ from each other, the probability $P_{\text{cross}}$
of the thrown needle crossing one of these lines can be expressed as:

$$ \label{eq:prob}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{2L}{\pi D}.
$$

# The proof of experiment

The proof for this particular case is quite trivial. Suppose a needle of length
$L$ is dropped onto a floor with evenly spaced parallel lines of width $D$ (see fig. 1).
The probability of the event where the needle crosses a line was shown above
(see eq. \eqref{eq:prob}), but how to get this result?

To solve the problem we must develop a method of "locating" a needle of length
$L$ that has fallen onto the floor. Let $x$ be the perpendicular distance from
the end of the needle nearest you to the nearest line above it. Let $\theta$ be
the acute angle between the needle and a line through the end of the needle
nearest you, parallel to the line (see fig. 2).

Now let $t$ be the perpendicular distance from the other end of the needle to
this line. We see that $sin{\theta} = \frac{t}{L}$, so $t = Lsin{\theta}$.

It can be seen, if $t > x$, then the needle will cross the line. Thus, we have a
successful toss when $x < Lsin{\theta}$. We also note that the following
restrictions fall on $\theta$ and $x$: $0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$ and 
$0 \leq x \leq D$.



$$ \label{eq:probability_proof}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{L\int_0^{\pi/2}{\sin{\theta}d\theta}}{D\frac{\pi}{2}}=\frac{(-\cos{\frac{\pi}{2}})-(-\cos{0})}{\frac{D\pi}{2L}}=\frac{2L}{D\pi}(-0+1)=\frac{2L}{\pi D},
$$

where $0\leqslant\theta\leqslant\pi/2$ is the acute angle between the needle, and
a line through the end of the needle nearest you, parallel to the lines
