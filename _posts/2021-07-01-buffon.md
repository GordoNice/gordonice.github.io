In the simplest case, the Buffon's needle problem is formulated as follows: if needles or
sticks of length $L$ were accidentally thrown on a flat surface with parallel lines
drawn on it at a distance $D \geq L$ from each other, the probability $P_{\text{cross}}$
of the thrown needle crossing one of these lines can be expressed as:

$$ \label{eq:MSE}
P_{\text{cross}}=\frac{2L}{\pi D}.
$$

\eqref{eq:MSE}
