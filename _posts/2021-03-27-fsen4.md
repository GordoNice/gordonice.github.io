I developed FSEN4 (FLUKA Spawn, Execute, and Notify) to simplify the workflow of managing [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/) input files. This toolkit automates the generation, execution, and monitoring of FLUKA simulations while providing notifications via email or Telegram. Once a simulation is complete, FSEN4 organizes the output in a way that seamlessly integrates with [Flair](https://flair.cern/) for efficient data processing.

## Key Features

- **Automated Input Generation**: Dynamically create [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/) input files, saving time and reducing the risk of manual errors.

- **Execution Management**: Run FLUKA simulations automatically, handling all the necessary processes to ensure smooth execution.

- **Real-time Notifications**: Get instant updates about the status of simulations via email or Telegram.

- **Flair-Compatible Output**: FSEN4 structures the simulation results in a way that works naturally with [Flair](https://flair.cern/), making data analysis and visualization easier.

- **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**: The CLI is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making FSEN4 accessible to a wide range of users.

- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust notification preferences, execution parameters, and other settings to fit specific workflow requirements.

FSEN4 is written in Python 3 and has been tested with versions 3.6 and 3.7. It relies on dependencies like NumPy and pyTelegramBotAPI for Telegram notifications.

Source code and further details are available in the [FSEN4 GitHub repository](https://github.com/GordoNice/FSEN4).
