# Why?

The idea of [FitsGeo](https://fitsgeo.readthedocs.io) development came to me
after some time of work with PHITS. [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/) is a
[Monte Carlo (MC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) transport code
similar to [MCNP](https://mcnp.lanl.gov/) and certainly has some advantages
comparing to other codes such as [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/home). However, one
main disadvantage related to convenience of use is visualization of geometry of input
files. By that I mean that you don't have a full control on your geometry while
preparing your input file as it does [Flair](http://flair.web.cern.ch/flair/),
which is advanced UI for FLUKA.

The part of the work related to geometry setting is usually the most
time-consuming and painstaking when working in such MC transport codes.

Also, if you can't just rotate your geometry and look on that from various angles
may result in some mistakes which later may cost a lot of time to debug and to rerun
these corrupted input files with bad geometries if you noticed these problems
with geometry only on a final stage while performing calculations.

All these highlighted problems suggests that some tool to create 3D visualization
of geometry from PHITS input files are in need. 

You may say, that, actually, PHITS is already have such options for visualization:
ANGEL code and recent PHIG-3D feature. Yes, you will be right, this helps, but
here I am talking about more CAD-like visualization where you have the ability to
manually put your objects, drag them, size them and so on, [see what Flair does in
this regard for example](https://flair.web.cern.ch/flair/tutorial/FLAIR3-FARM-introduction.pdf).
This is a really powerful tool which I want to see for PHITS as well, because I
worked some time with FLUKA+Flair and that was an amazing experience.

All these speculations stuck in my mind, and I wanted to create something for my
self to handle geometry with PHITS in easier way. Surely, FitsGeo is also not
the pure CAD system, it is just allows to reproduce all the defined via python coding
geometry and view it using [VPython](https://vpython.org/). Still, this approach
has some interesting features including OOP paradigm, due to use of Python and
some additional features like using
[databases with predefined materials](https://fitsgeo.readthedocs.io/en/master/material.html).

The visualization capability of FitsGeo now a bit outdated because of the new PHIG-3D tool
announced by PHITS team. However, at the time of FitsGeo development there wasn't
a tool to view your geometry interactively in 3D.

# Current status

I wanted to improve FitsGeo in future to be able to fully write input files and 
export all PHITS sections to files, but currently, FitsGeo is suspended, because
I am lazy and lack of enthusiasm, that was just a side project for me which helped
a lot in improvement of my skills in documentation and programming (however, I
want to say sorry for native English-speaking persons and more skilled programmers &#128579;).

The full code is available on the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/GordoNice/fitsgeo),
also, I've published a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.03298.pdf) with the
description of this package and detailed docs are available [here](https://fitsgeo.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

If you are interested in this project somehow, feel free to fork it from GitHub or
contact me for any suggestions!
