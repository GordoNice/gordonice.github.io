## Why?

The idea of [FitsGeo](https://fitsgeo.readthedocs.io) development came to me
after some time of work with PHITS. PHITS is a Monte Carlo (MC) transport code
similar to MCNP and certainly has some advantages comparing to other codes such
as FLUKA. However, one main disadvantage is visualization of geometry of input
files. By that I mean that you don't have a full control on your geometry while
preparing your input file as it does Flair, which is a tool for FLUKA for example.
And the part of the work related to geometry setting is usually the most
time-consuming and painstaking when working in such MC transport codes.

Also, if you can't just rotate your geometry and look on that from various angles
may result in some mistakes which later may cost a lot of time to debug and to rerun
these corrupted input files with bad geometries if you noticed these problems
with geometry only on a final stage while performing calculations.

All these highlighted problems suggests that some tool to create 3D visualization
of geometry from PHITS input files are in need. 

Will update this post soon...
