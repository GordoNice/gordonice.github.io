Managed to do syntax highlighting of PHITS input files for one of my favorite
text editors Sublime.

It looks like this:

It also makes it possible to use Sublime `build` feature to run PHITS input files
right inside the text editor! All thew files with instructions are available here: https://github.com/GordoNice/phits_sublime_support 

Feel free to improve it and enjoy!
