  abstract = {The high-energy accelerator-based simulation of both Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and secondary radiation, to which astronauts will be exposed within a spacecraft in deep space, is a very relevant task for the purposes of space radiobiology. In this work, a method of simulating continuous proton, neutron, and π±-meson spectra within the habitable module of a spacecraft is described. The methods are based on a linear combination of the energy spectra of particles emitted at various angles from three different targets bombarded by a high-energy proton beam. The consecutive irradiation of targets makes it possible to create in a certain volume near the beam a summary field that is similar in characteristics to the nucleon field inside the habitable module exposed to GCR averaged over solar activity.},

Suggested FitsGeo Python package helps to define surfaces as Python objects and manipulate them conveniently. VPython assists to view defined geometry interactively which boosts geometry development and helps with complicated cases. Every class that sets the surface object has methods with some extra properties. As well as geometry generation for PHITS input, additional modules developed for material and cell definition. Any user with a very basic knowledge of Python can define the geometry in a convenient way and use it in further research related to particle transport.},

The calculation has been performed for the mode of 197Au ion acceleration to an energy of 578 MeV/n The main dose-forming component of the radiation field around the building is neutrons of a wide energy range. Detailed models of an ion acceleration ring and the geometry of shields and building details are used in the calculation. The calculation results indicate that the adopted design decisions with the given rates of ion losses will ensure compliance with radiation-protection norms during the operation of the NICA booster.},

To estimate the dose, the fluence-to-effective dose equivalent conversion coefficients for the male astronauts (cohort of never smoking males aged 30-60 years) have been used.},

  abstract = {Radiobiological experiments with the irradiation of various biological samples by nuclei from boron to neon with a primary energy of 30-50 MeV/nucleon are performed on the U400M cyclotron of the Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The linear energy transfer (LET) of the nuclei in samples is calculated using the code Lise++. For reducing the energy of nuclei and increasing their LET, aluminum filters with different thickness are placed before samples. The presence of filters and other absorbers before a sample results in the production of secondary charged particles whose LET may strongly differ from the LET of primary nuclei of the beam. This also affects the accuracy of calculating the absorbed dose. For this reason, detailed calculations of particle fields in samples are performed using the Monte Carlo code for radiation transport in matter PHITS 3.20 for several variants of sample irradiation with thick absorbers before samples. The calculated LET distributions are analyzed and compared with the calculations using the code Lise++.},
