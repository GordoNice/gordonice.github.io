Installation Guide
==================

**FitsGeo** works under any operating system with **Python 3** interpreter and **pip** tool.

If you are familiar with Python and pip tool, simply type following command to install the FitsGeo package::

	$ pip install fitsgeo

or::

	$ pip3 install fitsgeo

If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 versions.

If you are a less advanced user, read the rest of the page.

Installation guide is divided in two parts: prerequisites (mainly Python installation) and main package installation.

Prerequisites --- Python interpreter
------------------------------------

First user need to check if Python interpreter is already installed. Try if one of the following commands (printing Python version) works::

    $ python --version
    $ python3 --version

Command ``python`` invokes either Python 2 or 3, while ``python3`` invokes only Python 3.

**FitsGeo** supports only modern Python 3 versions starting from *version 3.7*. Please check if interpreter version is supported.

If none of ``python`` and ``python3`` commands are present, then Python interpreter has to be installed. It is better to use the newest available version.

Python 3 installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to install Python under Linux is to use package manager:

* ``apt-get install python3`` for Debian and Ubuntu
* ``dnf install python3`` for Fedora
* ``yum install python3`` for CentOS and SLC

On some systems instructions mentioned above have to be prefixed with ``sudo`` command.

For Windows or macOS please visit official `Python webpage <https://www.python.org/>`_ for installation instructions.

Prerequisites --- pip tool
--------------------------

**pip** is a tool for installing and managing Python packages. This tool automatically downloads the packages from central Internet repository and installs them.

Try the following commands (printing pip version) in console, to make sure that pip tool is installed::

    $ pip --version
    $ pip3 --version

In a similar way to Python interpreter pip is a tool for Python 2 or 3, while pip3 works exclusively for Python 3. If none of these commands are present, then pip has to be installed.

pip installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the package installation for your Linux system. On some systems instructions mentioned below have to be prefixed with ``sudo`` command:

* ``apt-get install python3-pip`` for Debian and Ubuntu
* ``dnf install python3-pip`` for Fedora
* ``yum install python3-pip`` for CentOS and SLC

For Windows and macOS please visit official `Python webpage <https://www.python.org/>`_ for installation instructions.
