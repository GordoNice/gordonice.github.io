abstract: 'The estimation of the dose rates of astronauts inside the spacecraft habitable module with dimensions ∅6 m and length 12 m with an aluminum shell thickness of 15 g/cm$^2$ at the minimum and maximum of solar activity during flights in deep space has been presented. The estimation was based on the FLUKA calculations of the spectral characteristics of all components of the internal radiation field in the module from protons, deuterons, 3He, and nuclei with $2 \leq Z \leq 28$ of Galactic Cosmic Radiation. To estimate the dose, the fluence-to-effective dose equivalent conversion coefficients for the male astronauts (cohort of never smoking males aged 30-60 years) have been used.'

**Abstract:** The estimation of the dose rates of astronauts inside the spacecraft habitable module with dimensions ∅6 m and length 12 m with an aluminum shell thickness of 15 g/cm$^2$ at the minimum and maximum of solar activity during flights in deep space has been presented. The estimation was based on the FLUKA calculations of the spectral characteristics of all components of the internal radiation field in the module from protons, deuterons, 3He, and nuclei with $2 \leq Z \leq 28$ of Galactic Cosmic Radiation. To estimate the dose, the fluence-to-effective dose equivalent conversion coefficients for the male astronauts (cohort of never smoking males aged 30-60 years) have been used.
