abstract: 'The most important condition for starting work at the NICA accelerator complex, which is a powerful source of ionizing radiation, is to obtain a sanitary-epidemiological conclusion with the justification of a sanitary-protection zone around the facility. The size and configuration of the sanitary-protective zone around the NICA complex are determined by the mode of operation and the loss of particles in its various elements. Based on the calculations of the radiation situation performed earlier, the boundaries of the sanitary-protective zones have been defined for the heavy ions collision mode of the collider operation and for the additional mode in which high-energy protons interact in the collider.'

**Abstract:** The most important condition for starting work at the NICA accelerator complex, which is a powerful source of ionizing radiation, is to obtain a sanitary-epidemiological conclusion with the justification of a sanitary-protection zone around the facility. The size and configuration of the sanitary-protective zone around the NICA complex are determined by the mode of operation and the loss of particles in its various elements. Based on the calculations of the radiation situation performed earlier, the boundaries of the sanitary-protective zones have been defined for the heavy ions collision mode of the collider operation and for the additional mode in which high-energy protons interact in the collider.
