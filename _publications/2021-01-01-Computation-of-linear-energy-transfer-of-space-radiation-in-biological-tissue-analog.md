abstract: 'Charged particle linear energy transfer (LET) distributions of the inner radiation field within an interplanetary spacecraft caused by Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) are a good criterion of adequacy for accelerator-based GCR simulation. This paper presents the results of calculating the LET spectra inside the habitable module of the spacecraft (15 â€‹g/cm2 of Al shell) at the minimum and maximum of solar activity and comparing the calculations with the data obtained by the RAD dosimeter on the flight path to Mars in 2012. It is shown that the shape of the LET spectra weakly depends on the variation of solar activity over a wide range.'
