abstract: 'An easy way to define and visualize geometry for PHITS input files introduced. Suggested FitsGeo Python package helps to define surfaces as Python objects and manipulate them conveniently. VPython assists to view defined geometry interactively which boosts geometry development and helps with complicated cases. Every class that sets the surface object has methods with some extra properties. As well as geometry generation for PHITS input, additional modules developed for material and cell definition. Any user with a very basic knowledge of Python can define the geometry in a convenient way and use it in further research related to particle transport.'

**Abstract:** An easy way to define and visualize geometry for PHITS input files introduced. Suggested FitsGeo Python package helps to define surfaces as Python objects and manipulate them conveniently. VPython assists to view defined geometry interactively which boosts geometry development and helps with complicated cases. Every class that sets the surface object has methods with some extra properties. As well as geometry generation for PHITS input, additional modules developed for material and cell definition. Any user with a very basic knowledge of Python can define the geometry in a convenient way and use it in further research related to particle transport.
