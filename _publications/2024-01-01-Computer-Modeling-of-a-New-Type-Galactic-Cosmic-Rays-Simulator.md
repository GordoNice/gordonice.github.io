abstract: 'A new type of a galactic cosmic rays (GCR) simulator, provided at the JINR Laboratory of Radiation Biology, is potentially capable of generating a complex radiation field with inclusions of a variety of ions with a wide energy range and with required abundance at the charged particle accelerators. This complex multicomponent radiation field simulates radiation environment inside a spacecraft during an interplanetary flight, for example, to Mars. The paper provides an analytical description of the GCR simulator as well as a description of a specially developed software that enables selection of necessary parameters of a simulator model for creating relevant mixed radiation conditions. The software implements processing of data obtained with Monte Carlo-based FLUKA and PHITS programs, fitting and optimization of model parameters as well as data visualization tools. The investigation has been performed at the Laboratory of Radiation Biology, JINR.'

**Abstract:** A new type of a galactic cosmic rays (GCR) simulator, provided at the JINR Laboratory of Radiation Biology, is potentially capable of generating a complex radiation field with inclusions of a variety of ions with a wide energy range and with required abundance at the charged particle accelerators. This complex multicomponent radiation field simulates radiation environment inside a spacecraft during an interplanetary flight, for example, to Mars. The paper provides an analytical description of the GCR simulator as well as a description of a specially developed software that enables selection of necessary parameters of a simulator model for creating relevant mixed radiation conditions. The software implements processing of data obtained with Monte Carlo-based FLUKA and PHITS programs, fitting and optimization of model parameters as well as data visualization tools. The investigation has been performed at the Laboratory of Radiation Biology, JINR.
