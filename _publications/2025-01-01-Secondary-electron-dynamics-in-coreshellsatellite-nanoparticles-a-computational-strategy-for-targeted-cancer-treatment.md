abstract: 'As the global incidence of cancer escalates, there exists an urgent necessity for innovative therapeutic modalities. While radiation therapy is indispensable in oncology, it faces significant challenges in achieving an optimal equilibrium between tumour ablation and the preservation of surrounding healthy tissues. Noteworthy advancements such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) have enhanced the precision of treatment; however, their efficacy is still constrained by the accuracy of tumour delineation. The utilization of radiosensitizers, with a particular emphasis on metal nanoparticles, presents a promising avenue for augmenting the susceptibility of neoplastic cells to ionizing radiation. This research examines the potential of core-shell-satellite Fe$_3$O$_4$-SiO$_2$-Au nanoparticles as effective radiosensitizers. By investigating the interaction of individual nanoparticles situated within a water phantom of 20 micrometers in diameter with monochromatic photon beams at energies of 50, 100, and 150 keV, we analyse how variations in the structural composition of Au nanoparticles and their concentrations within these multifaceted nanoparticles influence the efficacy of radiation therapy, employing Monte Carlo simulations corroborated by the general-purpose radiation transport code PHITS. Our investigation aspires to refine nanoparticle-based methodologies to enhance cancer treatment outcomes, potentially facilitating the development of more targeted therapeutic interventions that minimize adverse effects while improving patient survival rates.'

**Abstract:** As the global incidence of cancer escalates, there exists an urgent necessity for innovative therapeutic modalities. While radiation therapy is indispensable in oncology, it faces significant challenges in achieving an optimal equilibrium between tumour ablation and the preservation of surrounding healthy tissues. Noteworthy advancements such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) have enhanced the precision of treatment; however, their efficacy is still constrained by the accuracy of tumour delineation. The utilization of radiosensitizers, with a particular emphasis on metal nanoparticles, presents a promising avenue for augmenting the susceptibility of neoplastic cells to ionizing radiation. This research examines the potential of core-shell-satellite Fe$_3$O$_4$-SiO$_2$-Au nanoparticles as effective radiosensitizers. By investigating the interaction of individual nanoparticles situated within a water phantom of 20 micrometers in diameter with monochromatic photon beams at energies of 50, 100, and 150 keV, we analyse how variations in the structural composition of Au nanoparticles and their concentrations within these multifaceted nanoparticles influence the efficacy of radiation therapy, employing Monte Carlo simulations corroborated by the general-purpose radiation transport code PHITS. Our investigation aspires to refine nanoparticle-based methodologies to enhance cancer treatment outcomes, potentially facilitating the development of more targeted therapeutic interventions that minimize adverse effects while improving patient survival rates.
