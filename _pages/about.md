## About me

I'm a researcher at the Department of Radiation Research of the basic facilities
at the [Laboratory of Radiation Biology (LRB)](http://lrb.jinr.ru/index.php/en/) of the [JINR](http://www.jinr.ru/main-en/).
I completed a postgraduate course in [Dubna State University](https://int.uni-dubna.ru/) with major in physics and astronomy.

On this website you can find comprehensive information about me:
[list of publications](https://gordeev.page/publications/),
[CV](https://gordeev.page/cv/), [posts with some projects](https://gordeev.page/posts/).

## Field of work

My work in the lab is mainly related to calculations using Monte
Carlo transport codes such as [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/home)
and [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/), and analysis of the results of calculations,
for this purpose I use Python. I also have skills to work with
[GEANT4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1) and [ROOT](https://root.cern/) frameworks, as well as experience with C++ and Fortran languages, look at my [CV](https://gordeev.page/cv/)
