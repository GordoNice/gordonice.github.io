## About me

My name is Ivan Gordeev, at the moment I am a postgraduate student of [Dubna State
University](https://int.uni-dubna.ru/) with major in physics and astronomy.
I work as a researcher at the [Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR)](http://www.jinr.ru/main-en/)
in the [Laboratory of Radiation Biology (LRB)](http://lrb.jinr.ru/index.php/en/) in
the Radiation Research Department of radiation research of the JINR base facilities.

## Field of work

Part of my work in the laboratory is mainly related to calculations using Monte
Carlo transport codes such as [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/home)
and [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/), and analysis of the results of calculations,
for this purpose I use Python. I also have skills to work with
[GEANT4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1), [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework
and some experience with C++ and Fortran languages, see my [CV](https://gordeev.page/cv/) for the full
list of software in use and skills.

## Additional

On this website you can find comprehensive information about me:

One of my favorite physicists is Richard Feynman and I really like one of his
famous quotes: _What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand_. I take this expression
as my credo. And I interpret it in the way that if you can’t _create_ something,
no matter how: in your mind, or in real life --- by performing an experiment,
then you can’t understand it properly.

This means that to better understand something, you always need to invent new
approaches and develop new models that describe actual problem. After long and
persistent reflections and attempts to solve the problem, a solution comes.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me by email
or on the social network.
