I'm a researcher at the [JINR](http://www.jinr.ru/main-en/)
[Laboratory of Radiation Biology (LRB)](http://lrb.jinr.ru/index.php/en/), I'm in
the Radiation Research Department of the base facilities. Also, I'm a postgraduate
student of [Dubna State University](https://int.uni-dubna.ru/) with major in physics and astronomy.

On this website you can find comprehensive information about me:
[list of publications](https://gordeev.page/publications/),
[CV](https://gordeev.page/cv/), [posts with some projects](https://gordeev.page/posts/).

## Field of work

My work in the lab is mainly related to calculations using Monte
Carlo transport codes such as [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/home)
and [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/), and analysis of the results of calculations,
for this purpose I use Python. I also have skills to work with
[GEANT4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1), [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework
and some experience with C++ and Fortran languages, look at my [CV](https://gordeev.page/cv/)
for additional information.

## P.S.

One of my favorite physicists is Richard Feynman and I really like one of his
famous quotes: _What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand_. I take this expression
as my credo. And I interpret it in the way that if you can’t _create_ something,
no matter how: in your mind, or in real life --- by performing an experiment,
then you can’t understand it properly.

This means that to better understand something, you always need to invent new
approaches and develop new models that describe actual problem. After long and
persistent reflections and attempts to solve the problem, a solution comes.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me by email
