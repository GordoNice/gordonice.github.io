## About me

I am Ivan Gordeev, a researcher at the [Laboratory of Radiation Biology (LRB)](http://lrb.jinr.ru/index.php/en/)
at the [Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR)](http://www.jinr.ru/main-en/) in Dubna, Russia.
I hold a [PhD in Physics and Mathematics](https://dissertations.jinr.ru/en/Dissertations/Materials/252) and specialize in radiation fields modeling for accelerator shielding and dosimetry.
My work focuses on using Monte Carlo transport codes like FLUKA and PHITS for radiation transport simulations,
along with expertise in GEANT4, ROOT, and programming languages such as Python, C++, and Fortran.
I am passionate about radiation safety, computational modeling, and developing shielding strategies for accelerators.

If you have any additional questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me by email
or on the social network!
