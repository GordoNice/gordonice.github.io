My name is Ivan Gordeev, at the moment I am a postgraduate student of [Dubna State
University](https://int.uni-dubna.ru/) with major in physics and astronomy.
I work as a junior researcher at [JINR](http://www.jinr.ru/main-en/)
in the [Laboratory of Radiation Biology](http://lrb.jinr.ru/index.php/en/) in
the research group of radiation fields of the JINR base facilities.

Part of my work is mostly computing using Monte Carlo transport codes such as [FLUKA](https://fluka.cern/home)
and [PHITS](https://phits.jaea.go.jp/), and analyzing the calculated results,
for this purpose I use Python. I also have skills to work with
[GEANT4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/node/1), [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework
and some experience with C++ and Fortran languages.
